# Overview

This Taskfile defines automation tasks to simplify development workflows and ensure consistency across environments.

It abstracts repetitive shell commands into named tasks you can run with:

```bash
task <task-name> # runs a task
```

You can list all available tasks with:

```bash
task --list-all
```
